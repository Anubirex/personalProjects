            <h3>
                Graphics 9/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                Beginning with the visuals, the game&apos;s performance is exceptional, particularly considering it operates on an engine that is outdated. This detail is quickly overshadowed by the visual experience it delivers. Each scene within the game could be framed as a work of art, with breathtaking landscapes on every planet, underscoring the game’s remarkable aesthetic achievement. The character and enemy designs are impressive, with termanids and automatons meeting their end in a graphically pleasing manner, adding to the game&apos;s visceral appeal. The destruction mechanics are a highlight, where the aftermath of combat—be it craters left by heavy ordinance, the disintegration of structures, or even the wear seen on players&apos; gear like the helldiver&apos;s cape—contributes to a robust visual narrative. The weapons and combat visuals are crafted with care, ensuring that each engagement is not only tactically satisfying but also a feast for the eyes. The implementation of stratagems, called down from the skies, enriches the gameplay with a dynamic layer of strategy while maintaining visual splendor. Explosions pack a punch both visually and impactfully, reinforcing the game&apos;s commitment to an immersive experience. The game sets a high bar for visual presentation. From the design of the weapons and the exhilarating gunfights to the grandeur of calling in stratagems and the spectacle of explosions, every element is meticulously rendered to captivate the player. Additionally, the depiction of alien worlds and the player&apos;s battleship are executed with the same attention to detail, ensuring a consistently stunning visual experience. In essence, the game&apos;s graphical prowess significantly enhances its overall appeal, serving as a testament to the developers&apos; ability to craft an engaging and immersive world.

            <h3>
                Gameplay 10/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The game boasts an extensive arsenal of weapons and stratagems, offering a diverse range of playstyles that remain effective even at higher levels of difficulty. This variety ensures that players can find their niche within the game, tailoring their approach to combat as they see fit. The distinction between combating automatons versus engaging with the termanids offers a dynamic shift in gameplay, effectively doubling the player&apos;s experience. With nine levels of difficulty, the game unfolds a myriad of possibilities for engagement, allowing players to customize their experience to their liking. The tactile satisfaction derived from utilizing the game&apos;s armaments and strategic assets is noteworthy; each tool and weapon not only feels substantial in use but also has a visible, significant impact on the flow of battle. This game distinguishes itself with a gameplay experience that is unparalleled, marked by a depth and intensity that remains engaging over hundreds of hours of play. I personally have more than 200 hours into the game, the allure remains undiminished, with each encounter unfolding like a scene from an epic film. The ambiance is meticulously crafted, featuring orchestral scores that swell in the background, sometimes there is a light fog that clings to the battlegrounds, and always the looming presence of your spaceship in the sky above. Enemies emerge from the mist, creating a dramatic tension heightened by the vivid light of muzzle flashes and the spectacular demise of foes, enhancing the cinematic quality of every battle. In essence, each confrontation is not just a skirmish; it&apos;s an immersive, cinematic event.

                Performance 8/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The game does encounter some technical setbacks, including occasional crashes, bugs, and infrequent issues with frame rate inconsistencies. However, these are minor when weighed against the overall excellence in both graphical fidelity and gameplay mechanics. Having invested over 200 hours into this title, my experience has been largely free from significant graphical disruptions. On the gameplay front, there have been isolated incidents—such as character models not rendering correctly, becoming entrapped within the terrain, or experiencing unexpected physics anomalies—that momentarily break the flow of play. Yet, these glitches are sparse and do not detract from the game&apos;s immersive qualities. It&apos;s worth noting that such issues are not pervasive and seem to occur randomly, without severely impacting the overall gaming experience. Comparatively, my extensive time with this game has seen fewer glitches than what I&apos;ve encountered in shorter spans within higher-budget titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Battlefield 2042. This speaks volumes about the game&apos;s quality and the developers&apos; commitment to creating a robust, immersive world, ensuring that these occasional technical hiccups do not overshadow the otherwise stellar gameplay experience.

            <h3>
                Story 9/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                Arrowhead&apos;s approach to narrative is a novel venture within the gaming landscape, crafting a unique blend of community-driven campaigns pitted against a Game Master—Joel, in a nod to the classic Dungeons & Dragons style of storytelling. This innovative method has revitalized the concept of narrative within the context of a large-scale war game, earning them commendation for not only venturing into uncharted territory but also executing it with remarkable skill. The inclusion of major and personal orders enriches the gameplay experience, offering players the opportunity to engage in the unfolding story in a manner that is both dynamic and immersive. These orders, along with regular in-game updates and notices, serve as the primary narrative vehicle, seamlessly integrating story elements with gameplay. This storytelling technique not only enhances the overall gaming experience but also synergizes perfectly with the game&apos;s other facets, showcasing Arrowhead&apos;s ingenuity. By adopting this flexible narrative framework, they have afforded themselves the liberty to endlessly innovate, introducing new elements or phasing out others as they see fit. This open-ended approach keeps the game perpetually fresh and engaging, offering players a sense of participation in an evolving story. For an extraction shooter, Arrowhead has set a new standard for narrative excellence, offering a compelling and immersive story that stands out in the genre.

            <h3>
                Difficulty 9/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The game offers a wide range of difficulty settings, enabling players to customize their experience to match their mood or desired challenge level. For those seeking a more relaxed session with ample bug-slaying, settings between levels 5 and 6 are ideal. Conversely, players looking for a more intense and demanding experience can ramp up the difficulty to levels 7 through 9. This flexible approach to difficulty settings ensures the game remains accessible and enjoyable for a broad spectrum of players, from those who game casually to the more dedicated enthusiasts. Despite my appreciation for the game&apos;s difficulty spectrum, as a seasoned player with over 200 hours invested, I find myself yearning for even greater challenges, potentially in the form of levels 10 to 12. At my current level of expertise, managing to complete level 9 challenges without incurring any deaths has become a regular occurrence, diminishing the sense of achievement that once came with overcoming these hurdles. As a player who thrives on mastering games to their fullest, the prospect of additional, more formidable levels would greatly enhance my engagement. Although the current highest setting, level 9, presents a substantial challenge with little room for error, I remain hopeful for future updates that introduce even more demanding difficulties to conquer.

            <h3>
                Multiplayer 8/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The implementation of multiplayer in the game is commendable, though it&apos;s not without its shortcomings, which impact its overall rating. A significant oversight is the absence of a comprehensive multiplayer tutorial, leading to misconceptions among players regarding team dynamics. A common misunderstanding is the belief that resources such as samples and items collected in-game are exclusive to the player who picks them up. This lack of awareness that rewards like super credits, medals, and other collectibles are shared among squad members has led to unnecessary conflicts, including kicking out and team killing players to hoard these supposed individual gains. This has, unfortunately, marred the gaming experience for many. Furthermore, the ease with which a player can be expelled from a game by the host is problematic. While the option to remove a disruptive player can be useful, the current system, which grants the host unilateral power to kick players for any reason, from disliking chosen stratagems to personal grievances, is flawed. A more equitable solution would be to introduce a voting mechanism for expulsion, requiring a consensus from at least half of the team members, thereby preventing abuse of this feature. Additionally, the game&apos;s reliance on a single host for mission continuity is a critical vulnerability. Should the host exit the game mid-mission, it results in the abrupt end of the session for all players, leading to the loss of progress and resources. Implementing a host migration feature, which would seamlessly transfer hosting duties to another player in the event of the original host&apos;s departure, is essential to ensure uninterrupted gameplay and preserve the integrity of the multiplayer experience.

            <h3>
                Monetization 10/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The game&apos;s approach to monetization earns a perfect score from me. Remarkably, it&apos;s possible to engage with the game for extensive periods without ever noticing the presence of a monetization scheme. The maximum expenditure at any given time is capped at $20 for super credits, with the in-game store featuring a rotation of armor sets available for just a few dollars each. This monetization strategy is notably refreshing within the current landscape of the gaming industry. Additionally, players have the opportunity to accrue super credits by simply participating in missions and discovering them throughout various maps. With a focused effort, it&apos;s feasible to collect 40-50 super credits per hour. Alternatively, engaging in gameplay at a natural pace allows for the gradual accumulation of these credits, which can amass sufficiently over time to unlock premium content, such as war bonds, without the necessity of additional spending. For instance, I managed to save up 1,000 credits through regular play, enabling me to unlock the latest arc weapons war bond without any extra financial outlay. It&apos;s crucial to highlight the permanence of war bonds within the game. They are not subject to expiration, thereby avoiding the exploitation of players&apos; fear of missing out for profit. Once introduced, a war bond remains a permanent feature of the game, accessible to all players regardless of when they choose to pursue it. This monetization model is exemplary, setting a high standard for fairness and player respect in live service games.

                Progression/Leveling 9/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The progression system in this game is excellently tuned, striking a perfect balance between experience points (XP) gained and the XP requirements for leveling up. The pace of leveling strikes an ideal middle ground—neither too sluggish nor excessively rapid. XP rewards are thoughtfully allocated based on the difficulty of the missions and the proficiency with which they are executed, making each reward feel genuinely earned and satisfying. The amount of XP awarded for completed missions is gratifying; I never experienced it as overly slow, maintaining a consistently enjoyable progression pace. Achieving the maximum level in the game is an engaging and rewarding journey, contributing to an overall positive gaming experience.

            <h3>
                End game (post level 50) 7/10
            </h3>
            <p>
                The endgame content, or rather the lack thereof, necessitates a deduction in my overall assessment. Once players achieve the maximum level, obtain every ship upgrade and stratagem, and maximize their ship&apos;s sample holdings, the remaining objectives narrow down to unlocking war bonds and, for those inclined, farming medals to complete the war bonds collection and chasing every achievement. Essentially, this means engaging with all available content, yet this does not constitute a distinct endgame phase—it&apos;s merely a continuation of the gameplay with all unlocks achieved. The daily routine of advancing through major and personal orders remains unchanged, a cycle familiar to all players, regardless of level. I find myself yearning for exclusive endgame content tailored for max-level players, such as specialized missions that could involve covert operations deep within enemy territories or unique challenges that are invisible to those yet to reach the pinnacle of progression. Such additions would provide a fresh sense of purpose and challenge for veteran players. Although I am optimistic that Arrowhead is developing these much-needed expansions, my review must be grounded in the game&apos;s current state. To those still progressing through the ranks, I advise not to hasten your journey to the top. At present, reaching the maximum level is but a milestone without substantial change in gameplay experience. Enjoy the journey and the content as it unfolds, without the rush towards an endgame that, for now, remains underdeveloped.

            <p>
                I&apos;ve decided to add an extra section to my review, as it&apos;s absolutely warranted. Arrowhead Game Studios stands out as one of the premier development teams I&apos;ve encountered. Their approach is characterized by transparency, integrity, and efficiency. They don&apos;t shy away from issues; rather, they tackle them head-on, often rolling out patches within a week of identifying any bugs. Their steadfast adherence to their own vision and values, despite external pressures, is commendable. In an era where many companies succumb to external influences and social demands, Arrowhead maintains a firm stance on keeping real-world politics outside of their gaming universe. This principle is refreshing and, in my opinion, should be a standard across the industry. Gaming serves as a sanctuary from reality, and Arrowhead&apos;s commitment to preserving this escape is both notable and admirable. This studio has not only earned my trust and patience through their actions, but thoroughly deserves it.

            </h3>
            <p>
                In summary, Helldivers 2 stands out as one of the most exceptional action shooter games ever developed, justifying its $40 price tag without reservation. For those considering diving into this game, rest assured, it is unlikely to leave you wanting. Despite the absence of a defined endgame, my enthusiasm for daily play remains unwavering. The game&apos;s allure lies in its endless fun, vast replayability, and the novelty of each mission and combat encounter. Helldivers 2 excels at immersing players in the role of a soldier tasked with overcoming daunting odds. There&apos;s simply no other gaming experience available today that parallels the distinctiveness and brilliance of Helldivers 2. It&apos;s a standout title that commands attention. Treat yourself to this game; it&apos;s a decision you&apos;re unlikely to regret.
