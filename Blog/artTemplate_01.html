                Imagine a battlefield where chaos reigns, where enemies swarm like a relentless tide, and the air crackles with the energy of impending doom. In this apocalyptic dance, there exists a weapon not just of destruction, but of artistry—the arc thrower. This isn't merely a tool of war; it's a conductor's baton, orchestrating a symphony of destruction with every charge and release. With the potential to decimate hordes of adversaries swiftly, the arc thrower demands not just knowledge of its power but a mastery of its rhythm. This guide isn't just about wielding a weapon; it's about becoming one with the arc thrower, transforming the battlefield into a stage where you are the undisputed protagonist. From the nuanced art of charging to the ballet of strategic retreats, prepare to journey through the mastery of a weapon that doesn't just defeat enemies—it annihilates them with style.

                Unleashing the Arc Thrower's Fury with Precision and Strategy
            </h3>
            <p>
                The arc thrower does extremely high dps and can shred through hordes of enemies very quickly when used correctly. The arc thrower needs to be charged to be fired, therefore it is necessary to know your surroundings when using this weapon. Keep distance between yourself and the enemies, this will allow for time to charge your shots, and provide protection; because the arc thrower is terrible at close quarters. When aiming at enemies, aim slightly above them, the arc likes to arc down to the ground, by aiming slightly above enemies you will work with the natural behavior of the arc and allow it to arc down into the enemies. The time it takes to go from no charge to shooting an arc at an enemy is relatively short, (if done correctly) you can charge and release a shot in the time it takes you to dive to the ground. After the first fully charged shot the subsequent shots only need to be charged halfway before firing, making timing crucial for achieving maximum damage.

            <h3>
                Orchestrating the Arc Thrower's Power in the Heat of Battle
            </h3>
            <p>
                You may be wondering, how do I put this all together in order to use the arc thrower most effectively? Here is the basic strategy: when engaging a group of bugs, start with a fully charged shot at the center of the group to do maximum damage. After the first fully charged shot your follow up shots only need to be half charged allowing for more rapid firing. Once you have engaged a group of bugs the hunters will begin to jump to your right and left flanks while the rest push up the middle at you. The optimal strategy for dealing with this bug push is to walk backwards shooting rapidly, working from left to right and back again sweeping 180 degrees in front of you. Do not allow any hunters to get onto your flanks or get in close, choose high priority targets first. High priority meaning the highest threat. Remember while sweeping back and forth in front of you quick firing, aim slightly above the enemies, this will help mitigate blank shots or shots arcing to dead bugs. If you fire a series of blank shots, don’t worry, just fully charge the arc thrower before firing again, after the fully charged shot you will be able to rapid fire again.

            <h3>
                Maneuvering and Adapting with the Arc Thrower
            </h3>
            <p>
                If a bug happens to get in close, don&apos;t panic, there is an easy solution that does not require swapping weapons: first begin charging your arc thrower, then dive away from the enemy, as you dive turn to aim at the bug, once you have charged the shot (should be charged by mid dive) you can release the arc eliminating the threat. This can be repeated until all close threats are cleared out. If you ever find yourself surrounded by hunters, don&apos;t waste your time trying to charge up shots, quickly swap to your primary weapon and use it to clear all close threats before swapping back to the arc thrower. If you need to engage an enemy and a teammate is standing on the other side of that enemy, swap to your primary and use it instead, or the arc will arc to your teammate and kill them.

            <h3>
                Eliminating Chargers with the Arc Thrower's Focused Fury
            </h3>
            <p>
                When taking down a charger it takes somewhere between five to ten fully charged shots to its head. The best way to take on chargers is to start firing fully charged shots straight into its head as soon as possible. Once the charger gets close just dive left or right out of its way, as it comes around for the next charge, get up and start shooting its head again. You can utilize the dive firing technique at this time to get in extra damage while you dive out of the way of its charges. You should be able to eliminate a charger in about five to ten seconds depending on the circumstances, and your ability to focus fire the chargers head. The very nice thing about the arc thrower is that while you are taking down the charger the arc will be arcing to nearby bugs, while you eliminate the charger you will also be clearing the horde.

            <h3>
                Crafting the Ultimate Loadout with the Arc Thrower
            </h3>
            <p>
                The arc thrower isn&apos;t the fastest at killing chargers, or wiping out hordes of enemies. What the arc thrower does best is handle a broad range of enemies very well. From the smallest bugs up to the enormous Bile Titans, the arc thrower can decimate them all. This versatility gives you the freedom to choose the stratagems you want. Let's select our stratagems now by starting with what we know about the arc thrower. We know you will be able to: clear large waves of small bugs quickly and easily, handle armored enemies such as the charger, and there is no need for ammo. This means you don’t need a stratagem to handle hordes of small bugs, or a stratagem specifically for chargers. You can bring a loadout to compliment the arc thrower and balance out what it can&apos;t do. The loadout that I use is: Eagle Air Strike (for clearing objectives), Eagle 500kg (for pesky Bile Titans), Personal Shield (helps keep hunters from slowing you), and the arc thrower (for maximum wave clear). Primary and secondary weapons are up to you, just choose something you like to use that also works well in close quarters fighting. I personally use the sickle and the auto pistol, I find they help for the moments when you are surrounded by hunters and need to just hold the trigger down. With this loadout I can solo objectives and bug breaches on level 9 difficulty, it makes you a powerful and versatile teammate.

            <h3>
                The Arc Thrower's Path to Galactic Supremacy
            </h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion, taking into account all available support weapons, and stratagems, nothing shines quite like the arc thrower in terms of operational versatility. Mastering this weapon will have you getting the most kills, objectives, samples, and least amount of deaths. I myself have had multiple deathless level 9 missions with 400+ kills, and using this build I achieved my personal record of 798 kills 1 death on a level 9 (see images below.) I have tried every support weapon and every primary weapon and many different stratagem combinations. I cannot find anything that packs a punch like this arc thrower loadout. I recommend this build to everyone, at least try it, and give yourself a few hours to effectively learn the arc throwers shot timing. Once you get the hang of it, it feels so good, smooth, powerful, and fast. Rise to the upper echelon of helldivers, take the arc thrower into battle, and spread managed democracy throughout the galaxy!
