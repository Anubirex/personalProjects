Make A Simple Counter:
Overview:
This counter will start from 0, there will be a + and a - button that
will add or remove a number, there will be a reset button as well that
will reset the value to 0.

considerations to add:
add an increment changer that allows the user to change the increment
that the counter increases by.

design:
Need a display for the current number
need buttons for +, -, and reset
need an input section for the user to change the increment if desired

functionality
default increment of +-1 each click of + or - buttons
reset button sets value back to 0
number can go positive or negative infinitely
user can define a custom increment if desired
+ and - buttons display will change to show increment
	ex: +1, +10, +15.
this will dynamically update based on the users selected increment
